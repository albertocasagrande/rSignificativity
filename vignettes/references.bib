It is designed to promote global standardization and diminish variation in the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) examination, and it is based on the best available evidence and expert consensus opinion. It establishes minimum acceptable technical parameters for prostate mpMRI, simplifies and standardizes terminology and content of reports, and provides assessment categories that summarize levels of suspicion or risk of clinically significant prostate cancer that can be used to assist selection of patients for biopsies and management. It is intended to be used in routine clinical practice and also to facilitate data collection and outcome monitoring for research.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister (MT) is proposed for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of 219937 −1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where  p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

	abstract = {Fast uniform random number generators with extremely long periods have been defined and implemented based on linear recurrences modulo 2. The twisted GFSR and the Mersenne twister are famous recent examples. Besides the period length, the statistical quality of these generators is usually assessed via their equidistribution properties. The huge-period generators proposed so far are not quite optimal in this respect. In this article, we propose new generators of that form with better equidistribution and ``bit-mixing'' properties for equivalent period length and speed. The state of our new generators evolves in a more chaotic way than for the Mersenne twister. We illustrate how this can reduce the impact of persistent dependencies among successive output values, which can be observed in certain parts of the period of gigantic generators such as the Mersenne twister.},

@article{10.1145/3460772,
	abstract = {F2-linear pseudorandom number generators are very popular due to their high speed, to the ease with which generators with a sizable state space can be created, and to their provable theoretical properties. However, they suffer from linear artifacts that show as failures in linearity-related statistical tests such as the binary-rank and the linear-complexity test. In this article, we give two new contributions. First, we introduce two new F2-linear transformations that have been handcrafted to have good statistical properties and at the same time to be programmable very efficiently on superscalar processors, or even directly in hardware. Then, we describe some scramblers, that is, nonlinear functions applied to the state array that reduce or delete the linear artifacts, and propose combinations of linear transformations and scramblers that give extremely fast pseudorandom number generators of high quality. A novelty in our approach is that we use ideas from the theory of filtered linear-feedback shift registers to prove some properties of our scramblers, rather than relying purely on heuristics. In the end, we provide simple, extremely fast generators that use a few hundred bits of memory, have provable properties, and pass strong statistical tests.},

	abstract = {We describe a new algorithm, vegas+, for adaptive multidimensional Monte Carlo integration. The new algorithm adds a second adaptive strategy, adaptive stratified sampling, to the adaptive importance sampling that is the basis for its widely used predecessor vegas. Both vegas and vegas+ are effective for integrands with large peaks, but vegas+ can be much more effective for integrands with multiple peaks or other significant structures aligned with diagonals of the integration volume. We give examples where vegas+ is 2--19× more accurate than vegas. We also show how to combine vegas+ with other integrators, such as the widely available miser algorithm, to make new hybrid integrators. For a different kind of hybrid, we show how to use integrand samples, generated using MCMC or other methods, to optimize vegas+ before integrating. We give an example where preconditioned vegas+ is more than 100× as efficient as vegas+ without preconditioning. Finally, we give examples where vegas+ is more than 10× as efficient as MCMC for Bayesian integrals with D=3 and 21 parameters. We explain why vegas+ will often outperform MCMC for small and moderate sized problems.},

The book begins by considering the mathematical foundations of the analysis of algorithms and maintains this mathematical rigor throughout the work. The tools developed in these opening sections are then applied to sorting, data structures, graphs, and a variety of selected algorithms including computational geometry, string algorithms, parallel models of computation, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and more. This book's strength lies in its encyclopedic range, clear exposition, and powerful analysis. Pseudo-code explanation of the algorithms coupled with proof of their accuracy makes this book is a great resource on the basic tools used to analyze the performance of algorithms.},

@article{Casagrande:2024aa,
	abstract = {The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests are generally assumed to be independent of the prevalence of the disease as opposed to the predictive values, which depend on it. Nevertheless, daily practice shows that this is not the case, and the independence hypothesis appears to be only a coarse simplification of the real world, where the disease mechanisms and the limitations involved in the experiments may let the prevalence influence the sensitivity and specificity measures. Independence can be affected by clinical factors, such as spectrum bias, reader expectations, and referral filters, or impacted by the design of the diagnostic experiments, such as the selection of patients, verification bias, and imperfect reference standards. The information ratio was recently introduced as a metric for diagnostic test performance. It models the flow of information from the disease state to the reader as a ``diagnostic channel''and measures it as a single value in the interval {$[$}0.0,1.0{$]$}. The information ratio was defined to be prevalence-independent. This work extends the analysis of these metrics and shows that the information ratio is also robust with respect to both clinical and experiment-design-related perturbations.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate the use of "information graphs" as a means of characterizing diagnostic test performance. Methods: Basic concepts in information theory allow us to quantify diagnostic uncertainty and diagnostic information. Given the probabilities of the diagnoses that can explain a patient's condition, the entropy of that distribution is a measure of our uncertainty about the diagnosis. The relative entropy of the posttest probabilities with respect to the pretest probabilities quantifies the amount of information gained by diagnostic testing. Mutual information is the expected value of relative entropy and, hence, provides a measure of expected diagnostic information. These concepts are used to derive formulas for calculating diagnostic information as a function of pretest probability for a given pair of test operating characteristics. Results: Plots of diagnostic information as a function of pretest probability are constructed to evaluate and compare the performance of three tests commonly used in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The graphs illustrate the critical role that the pretest probability plays in determining diagnostic test information. Conclusions: Information graphs summarize diagnostic test performance and offer a way to evaluate and compare diagnostic tests.},

	abstract = {The fundamental information theory functions of entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information are directly applicable to clinical diagnostic testing. This is a consequence of the fact that an individual's disease state and diagnostic test result are random variables. In this paper, we review the application of information theory to the quantification of diagnostic uncertainty, diagnostic information, and diagnostic test performance. An advantage of information theory functions over more established test performance measures is that they can be used when multiple disease states are under consideration as well as when the diagnostic test can yield multiple or continuous results. Since more than one diagnostic test is often required to help determine a patient's disease state, we also discuss the application of the theory to situations in which more than one diagnostic test is used. The total diagnostic information provided by two or more tests can be partitioned into meaningful components.},

@article{Casagrande:2020a,
	abstract = {{\copyright} 2020, The Author(s). Agreement measures are useful tools to both compare different evaluations of the same diagnostic outcomes and validate new rating systems or devices. Cohen's kappa (κ) certainly is the most popular agreement method between two raters, and proved its effectiveness in the last sixty years. In spite of that, this method suffers from some alleged issues, which have been highlighted since the 1970s; moreover, its value is strongly dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the considered sample. This work introduces a new agreement index, the informational agreement (IA), which seems to avoid some of Cohen's kappa's flaws, and separates the contribution of the prevalence from the nucleus of agreement. These goals are achieved by modelling the agreement---in both dichotomous and multivalue ordered-categorical cases---as the information shared between two raters through the virtual diagnostic channel connecting them: the more information exchanged between the raters, the higher their agreement. In order to test its fair behaviour and the effectiveness of the method, IA has been tested on some cases known to be problematic for κ, in the machine learning context and in a clinical scenario to compare ultrasound (US) and automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) in the setting of breast cancer imaging.

We recapitulate development and definitions of the K (categories) by M (ratings) kappas (K×M), discuss what they are well- or ill-designed to do, and summarize where kappas now stand with regard to their application in medical research. The 2×M(M⩾2) intraclass kappa seems the ideal measure of binary reliability; a 2×2 weighted kappa is an excellent choice, though not a unique one, as a validity measure. For both the intraclass and weighted kappas, we address continuing problems with kappas. There are serious problems with using the K×M intraclass (K>2) or the various K×M weighted kappas for K>2 or M>2 in any context, either because they convey incomplete and possibly misleading information, or because other approaches are preferable to their use. We illustrate the use of the recommended kappas with applications in medical research. Copyright {\copyright} 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Diamond:1980,
	abstract = {Analysis of multiple noninvasive tests offers the promise of more accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but discordant test responses can occur frequently, and, when observed, result in diagnostic uncertainty. Accordingly, 43 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography were evaluated by noninvasive testing and the results subjected to analysis using Bayes' theorem of conditonal probability. The procedures used included electrocardiographic stress testing for detection of exercise-induced ST segment depression, cardiokymographic stress testing for detection of exercise-induced precordial dyskinesis, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for detection of exercise-induced relative regional hypoperfusion, and cardiac fluoroscopy for detection of coronary artery calcification. The probability for coronary artery disease was estimated by Bayes' theorem from each patient's age, sex, and symptom classification, and from the observed test responses. This analysis revealed a significant linear correlation between the predicted probability for coronary artery disease and the observed prevalence of angiographic disease over the entire range of probability from 0 to 100% (P<0.001 by linear regression). The 12 patients without angiographic disease had a mean posttest likelihood of only 7.0$\pm$2.6% despite the fact that 13 of the 60 historical and test responses were falsely 'positive.' In contrast, the mean posttest likelihood was 94.1$\pm$2.8% in the 31 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease, although 45 of the 155 historical and test responses were falsely 'negative.' In 8 of the 12 normal patients, the final posttest likelihood was under 10% and in 26 of the 31 coronary artery disease patients, it was over 90%. These estimates also correlated well with the pooled clinical judgment of five experienced cardiologists (P<0.001 by linear regression). The observed change in probability for disease for each of the 15 different test combinations correlated with their information content predicted according to Shannon's theorem (P<0.001 by linear regression). These results support the use of probability analysis in the clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease and provide a formal basis for comparing the relative diagnostic effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different test combinations.},

	abstract = {The inherent imperfection of clinical diagnostic tests introduces uncertainty into their interpretation. The magnitude of diagnostic uncertainty after any test result may be quantified by information theory. The information content of the electrocardiographic ST-segment response to exercise, relative to the diagnosis of angiographic coronary artery disease, was determined using literature-based pooled estimates of the true- and false-positive rates for various magnitudes of ST depression from < 0.5 mm to ≥ 2.5 mm. This analysis allows three conclusions of clinical relevance. First, the diagnostic information content of exercise-induced ST-segment depression, interpreted by the standard 1.0-mm criterion, averages only 15% of that of coronary angiography. Second, there is a 41% increase in information content when the specific magnitude of ST-segment depression is analyzed, as opposed to the single, categorical 1-mm criterion. Third, the information obtained from ECG stress testing is markedly influenced by the prevalence of disease in the population tested, being low in the asymptomatic and typical angina groups and substantially greater in groups with nonanginal chest pain and atypical angina. The quantitation of information has broad relevance to selection and use of diagnostic tests, because one can analyze objectively the value of different interpretation criteria, compare one test with another and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of both a single test and potential testing combinations.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic test accuracy, based on sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values (dichotomous case), and on ROC analysis (continuous case), should be expressed with a single, coherent index. We propose to modelize the diagnostic test as a flow of information between the disease, that is, a hidden state of the patient, and the physicians. We assume that (1) sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive/false-negative rates are the probabilities of a binary asymmetric channel; (2) the diagnostic channel information is measured by mutual information. We introduce two summary measures of accuracy, namely the information ratio (IR) for the dichotomous case, and the global information ratio (GIR) for the continuous case. We apply our model to a study by Pisano et al. (N Engl J Med 353(17):1773--1783, 2005), who compared digital versus film mammography, in diagnosing breast cancer in a screening population of 42,760 women. In film mammography, the maximum IR (0.178) corresponds to the standard cutoff of sensitivity and specificity provided by the ROC analysis (GIR 0.200). Maximum IR and GIR for digital mammography are higher (0.201 and 0.229, respectively), but IR corresponds to a cutoff with higher sensitivity but lower specificity, thus suggesting that larger information provided by digital mammography carries the risk of more false-positive cases.},

@article{Girometti:2017,
	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the agreement between automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) and conventional ultrasound (US) as a second-look (SL) tool for assessing additional findings found on MRI. Methods: Over a 7-month period, we prospectively assigned to SL-US and SL-ABVS all patients undergoing 1.5 T breast MRI in whom additional findings were found. Five experienced breast radiologists independently interpreted SL-US and SL-ABVS in blinded sessions to evaluate the detection rate of MRI findings and assign them to BI-RADS categories. We calculated the agreement between the two methods in assessing MRI findings as significant (BI-RADS 3-5) versus not significant (BI-RADS 1-2), as well as their cancer detection rate. Results: In a population of 131 patients, SL-ABVS and SL-US showed a comparable detection rate of MRI findings (69.3 vs. 71.5%) (p > 0.05; McNemar test), with an almost perfect agreement in assessing them as significant or not (k = 0.94). This translated into a comparably high cancer detection rate (83.8% for SL-ABVS vs. 87.0% for SL-US). Only 1/31 cancers was missed by SL-ABVS. Conclusions: SL-ABVS and SL-US are nearly equivalent in assessing the significance of MRI findings, leading to a comparable cancer detection rate. SL-ABVS has the potential to replace SL-US in the SL scenario. Key Points: * SL-ABVS shows almost perfect agreement with SL-US in assessing MRI findings. * SL-ABVS shows a comparably high cancer detection rate with respect to SL-US. * SL-ABVS has the potential to replace SL-US in evaluating additional MRI findings.},

	abstract = {Background: Healthcare researchers often use multiple healthcare survey instruments to examine a particular patient symptom. The use of multiple instruments can pose some interesting research questions, such as whether the outcomes produced by the different instruments are in agreement. We tackle this problem using information theory, focusing on mutual information to compare outcomes from multiple healthcare survey instruments. Methods: We review existing methods of measuring agreement/disagreement between the instruments and suggest a procedure that utilizes mutual information to quantitatively measure the amount of information shared by outcomes from multiple healthcare survey instruments. We also include worked examples to explain the approach. Results: As a case study, we employ the suggested procedure to analyze multiple healthcare survey instruments used for detecting delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) in community-dwelling older adults. In addition, several examples are used to assess the mutual information technique in comparison with other measures, such as odds ratio and Cohen's kappa. Conclusions: Analysis of mutual information can be useful in explaining agreement/disagreement between multiple instruments. The suggested approach provides new insights into and potential improvements for the application of healthcare survey instruments.},

A normalized weighted mutual information index improves upon the traditional intercoder agreement index in a number of ways, key being that there is no need to develop a model of error generation before use; comparison across experiments is easier; and that ratings are based on the distribution of agreement across categories, not just an overall agreement level. {\copyright} Statistics Sweden.},

	abstract = {Background. To select a proper diagnostic test, it is recommended that the most specific test be used to confirm (rule in) a diagnosis, and the most sensitive test be used to establish that a disease is unlikely (rule out). These rule-in and rule-out concepts can also be characterized by the likelihood ratio (LR). However, previous papers discussed only the case of binary tests and assumed test results already known. Methods. The author proposes using the 'Kullback-Leibler distance' as a new measure of rule-in/out potential. The Kullback-Leibler distance is an abstract concept arising from statistics and information theory. The author shows that it integrates in a proper way two sources of information - the distribution of test outcomes and the LR function. The index predicts the fate of an average subject before testing. Results. Analysis of real and hypothetical data demonstrates its applications beyond binary tests. It works even when the conventional methods of dichotomization and ROC curve analysis fail. Conclusions. The Kullback-Leibler distance nicely characterizes the before-test rule-in/out potentials. It offers a new perspective from which to evaluate a diagnostic test.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Several SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays have been developed recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Two quantitative automated immunoassays (Maglumi{\texttrademark}2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed. This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers. Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan. Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records. Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples. Results: Maglumi{\texttrademark} IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4 % versus 64.3 %). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively. The two tests showed similar specificity for IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively. The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands. The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70 %) without any significant differences. The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91 %--94 %) after 14 days. Conclusion: This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.},

@article{Okada:1978,
	abstract = {In a given medical diagnostic system, each clinical data item is not stochastically independent of each other. As information for diagnosis, each item has its relative significance. The method was developed to reduce the amount of clinical data by eliminating relatively insignificant items. The procedure of the data reduction consists of the following two steps: 1. Identify the least significant item; 2. Test the correctness of the diagnosis without the item identified in the first step. During the study, the function was derived to give the measurement for the relative significance. In step 1, the function is evaluated for the data items to determine the order of significance. The computed value is defined as ``the weighted entropy''. The weight is given according to the degree of the similarity among the data items, that is, the order of significance is attributed to the degree of similarity. These two steps are repeated until the test in step 2 results in a failure. At that point, we should obtain the minimal set of items with which the diagnosis is assured to be as reliable as with the original set of items.

The technique combines receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with information theory and cost-benefit analysis to accomplish this. The program is menu driven and highly interactive; it generates 13 possible user-determined ASCII disk files which can be easily converted to graphs. These graphs allow the user to make detailed comparisons among various diagnostic tests for all values of disorder prevalence, and also provide guidelines for cut-off selection in order to optimize tests. These techniques are applied to three published studies of the enzyme screening assay for diagnosis of infection with the HIV virus. We show how graphs produced by this program can be used to compare and optimize these diagnostic tests. The program is written for an IBM-compatible microcomputer running on a DOS operating system. {\copyright} 1989.},

	abstract = {New diagnostic techniques must be evaluated for their intrinsic accuracy and for their applicability to particular patient groups in specific clinical settings. Using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and concepts from information theory, we have developed a new mathematical and graphical method that can evaluate, compare, and optimize the performance of diagnostic tests for any value of disorder prevalence. Our analytic method is appropriate to any test that sorts disordered from nondisordered subjects using a continuous or nonbinary diagnostic variable; its characterization of the fundamental properties of such tests thus has important implications for the evaluation and optimization of diagnostic modalities used by clinicians in all medical specialties. We demonstrate our method using published data from five studies that used sleep architecture as a "biological marker" for depression. Our analysis confirms that REM latency is comparable to the dexamethasone suppression test in its ability to discriminate depressed from control subjects. For each of the five studies, we show how optimal REM latency cut-off times may be selected so that diagnostic information yield is maximized, and we compare the ability of each study to detect depressed subjects in populations where the prevalence of affective disorder can be specified. {\copyright} 1990.},

@article{Wu:2013,
	abstract = {This study aims to determine the most informative mammographic features for breast cancer diagnosis using mutual information (MI) analysis. Our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved database consists of 44,397 consecutive structured mammography reports for 20,375 patients collected from 2005 to 2008. The reports include demographic risk factors (age, family and personal history of breast cancer, and use of hormone therapy) and mammographic features from the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. We calculated MI using Shannon's entropy measure for each feature with respect to the outcome (benign/malignant using a cancer registry match as reference standard). In order to evaluate the validity of the MI rankings of features, we trained and tested na{\"\i}ve Bayes classifiers on the feature with tenfold cross-validation, and measured the predictive ability using area under the ROC curve (AUC). We used a bootstrapping approach to assess the distributional properties of our estimates, and the DeLong method to compare AUC. Based on MI, we found that mass margins and mass shape were the most informative features for breast cancer diagnosis. Calcification morphology, mass density, and calcification distribution provided predictive information for distinguishing benign and malignant breast findings. Breast composition, associated findings, and special cases provided little information in this task. We also found that the rankings of mammographic features with MI and AUC were generally consistent. MI analysis provides a framework to determine the value of different mammographic features in the pursuit of optimal (i.e., accurate and efficient) breast cancer diagnosis. {\copyright} 2013 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.},

Purpose: To compare the accuracy of clinical models, mpMRI, and mpMRI plus clinical models in predicting stage ≥pT3 of PCa. Study Type: Prospective monocentric cohort study. Population: Seventy-three patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2016--2018. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T using turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging, single-shot echoplanar diffusion-weighted imaging, and T1-weighted high-resolution-isotropic-volume-examination (THRIVE) contrast-enhanced imaging. Assessment: We calculated the probability of extraprostatic extension (EPE) using the PT and MSKCC, as well as the CAPRA score. Three readers with 2--8 years of experience in mpMRI independently staged PCa on imaging. Statistical Tests: Receiver operating characteristics analysis and logistic regression analysis to investigate the per-patient accuracy of mpMRI vs. clinical models vs. mpMRI plus clinical models in predicting stage ≥pT3. The alpha level was 0.05. Results: Median probability for EPE and MSKCCn was 27.3% and 47.0%, respectively. Median CAPRA score was 3. Stage ≥pT3 occurred in 32.9% of patients. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.62 for PT, 0.62 for MSKCCn, 0.64 for CAPRA, and 0.73--0.75 for mpMRI (readers 1--3) (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Compared with mpMRI, the combination of mpMRI with PT or MSKCCn provided lower AUCs (P > 0.05 for all the readers), while the combination with CAPRA provided significantly higher (P < 0.05) AUCs in the case of readers 1 and 3. On multivariable analysis, mpMRI by reader 1 was the only independent predictor of stage ≥pT3 (odds ratio 7.40). Data Conclusion: mpMRI was more accurate than clinical models and mpMRI plus clinical models in predicting stage ≥pT3, except for the combination of mpMRI and CAPRA in two out of three readers. Level of Evidence: 2. Technical Efficacy: Stage 2. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;50:1604--1613.},
